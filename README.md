# A list of open WMS/WMTS/XYZ servers

[Live browser](https://picterra.github.io/awesome-open-wms/)

You can try these in [Picterra](https://picterra.ch/) or in QGIS.

## Development

This is a static app, so you can simply serve it using python for example :

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999
```

To test on another Picterra instance, modify the PICTERRA_BASE_URL in `app.js`
